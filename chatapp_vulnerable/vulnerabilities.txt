SQL injection:
Forgot password page is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Input field is not 
properly sanitized and this leads to blind SQL injection vulnerability.

Reflected XSS:
Sign up page is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This is also due to unsanitized input fields
and this page has more than 1 input fields, so each one is vulnerable to multiple 
vulnerabilities.

Command injection:
Ping page is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability, this page is added as a new
feature to the web app. Command injection is caused due to getting unnecessary characters
as well as more characters than needed for ping command.

Open URL redirection:
Ping page is also vulnerable to open URL redirection vulnerability, which is due to a lack 
of security to PHP header.

Stored XSS:
This vulnerability can be found on the feedback page which is a new feature of the web app.
This vulnerability is due to getting inputs without converting HTML special characters

IDOR:
The reset password page is vulnerable to IDOR vulnerability. IDOR was found in the reset password
page because of no additional verification method and accessing the same table to reset
passwords.

PHP injection:
The feedback page of the web app is both vulnerable to stored XSS as well as PHP injection.
This is mainly due to the method of getting input with a validation check.
